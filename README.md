# Equation Solver Application Using Android

## About
In this project, we are solving different equations of linear and quadratic type along with solution and graphs which provide a better understanding of the equation. Simplicity is given more importance than designing. All the possible aspects of the system are taken into consideration. User friendliness is the aim in this project.

## Objectives
* To find the solutions of a given mathematical equation.
* To show the graph of a given mathematical equation.
* To show the graph of a given mathematical equation.
* To create efficient algorithms for solving an equation string.
* To find and display errors in a given equation and provide a detailed description.
* To write the code of our software in such a manner that it could be easily understood and new features can be added whenever necessary.
