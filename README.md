# Equation Solver Application Using Android

## About
In this project, we are solving different equations of linear and quadratic type along with solution and graphs which provide a better understanding of the equation. Simplicity is given more importance than designing. All the possible aspects of the system are taken into consideration. User friendliness is the aim in this project.

## Objectives
* To find the solutions of a given mathematical equation
* To show the 2D graph of the given mathematical equation and its solution
* To create efficient algorithms for solving an equation
* To find and display errors in a given equation

## Advantages
* System of linear equations can be solved instantly
* Two Dimensional Graphs provide better understanding of the equation and its solution
* Any single variable Quadratic Equation can be solved including complex roots
